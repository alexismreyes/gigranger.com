  "job-matching-note-1": "We are currently using a <strong>free-tier, general-purpose AI model</strong>. While this enables testing the functionality at no cost, the results may not be fully accurate. It also depends on how your resume is structured to improve accurate results.",

  "job-matching-note-4": "You may optionally use the <strong>Category</strong> filter above the button to narrow the comparison to a specific job field. If no category is selected, the matching process runs against all jobs which of course will take more time.",
