## gigranger.com - A Employment Platformüßë‚Äçüíº

A full-featured job portal application that allows **recruiters** to post and manage job listings, and **job seekers** to find, apply, and track job applications ‚Äî with a seamless real-time chat system connecting them.

This project showcases real-world, production-ready features such as:

- üîê **Authentication and role-based access**

- üìÑ **Resume uploads with automatic S3/local detection**

- üì¨ **Email notifications via RabbitMQ-based microservice**

- üß† **AI-powered resume-to-job matching using Hugging Face**

- üóÇÔ∏è **Application status tracking with history and comments**

- üîé **Filtering, pagination, and admin-level CRUD operations**

- üí¨ **Live chat with offline message sync and unread badges**

- üåê **Multilingual support with 10 languages via i18next**

The backend leverages a **modular microservices architecture** for improved scalability:

- Email notifications are offloaded to a dedicated **RabbitMQ-powered email microservice**.

- Resume-job matching is powered by a standalone **LLM-based microservice**, deployed securely and independently.

These design choices decouple long-running or compute-heavy tasks from the main app, improving responsiveness and enabling future scalability.

## üß© Installation Guide

You can now run the entire application using Docker without needing to install Node.js, MySQL, or any local dependencies ‚Äî everything runs in containers.

1.  **Clone the Repository**

> git clone https://github.com/alexismreyes/gigranger.com.git <br>

> cd gigranger.com

2. **Configure Environment Files**

Create the following `.env` files for your local development environment:

- `./backend/.env.development`
- `./frontend/.env.development`
- `./email-service/.env`
- `./jobmatching-service/.env`

Use the sample variables listed in the [üîê Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section to fill out each file correctly.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**
>
> - Use a real email address to receive application notifications. All preloaded users in the database use the password `123456789`.
> - Use the MySQL username and password defined in the `/database/init.sql` file, or set your own credentials ‚Äî just ensure they match across all relevant `.env` files.
> - The `jobmatching-service` requires proper API access to Hugging Face so you need to request yours at the huggingface site https://huggingface.co and use it at the .evn file from the /jobmatching-service folder
>   <br><br>

3.  **Run the App Using Docker**

_üêß For Linux/macOS:_

Use the provided Makefile:

make run # Start all containers

make stop # Stop containers (keep data)

make reset # Remove everything and reinitialize from SQL dump

make rebuild # Full clean + rebuild + launch

_ü™ü For Windows:_

Use the interactive script:

manage.bat

This script will show a menu with options to run, stop, reset, or rebuild the app using Docker Compose.

### Notes on Database Initialization

- The database will be automatically created and seeded using the included `employment_db.sql` file included within the database folder.

- You do **not** need to import the SQL file manually.

- Data is persisted across runs using Docker volumes depending the option you choose from the make file or manage.bat file.

- Running a full reset (`make reset` or option 3 in `manage.bat`) will wipe all data and reload the schema from `employment_db.sql`.

## üê≥ Dockerized Microservices

As of the latest version, the app has been modularized using a microservices approach. Three new containers have been added, one dedicated to RabbitMQ message broker, another one Node.js email microservice container plus one more node container holding the job matching microservice:

| Container Name | Description |

| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `gigranger-frontend` | React frontend |

| `gigranger-backend` | Node.js + Express backend API |

| `gigranger-database` | MySQL instance with init + seed |

| `rabbitmq` | RabbitMQ message broker with management UI |

| `gigranger-email-service` | Node-based microservice that processes queued email jobs |

| `gigranger-jobmatching` | Node-based microservice that uses a Hugging Face model to analyze resume-to-job compatibility |

These containers are orchestrated using Docker Compose. All communication between services (e.g., backend ‚Üí RabbitMQ ‚Üí email-service) is handled asynchronously.

## üöÄ Features

üì¨ Notifications

- Email alerts are handled by a dedicated `gigranger-email-service` microservice.

- Messages are published to a RabbitMQ queue by the backend and processed asynchronously.

- Uses Nodemailer to send notifications to both recruiters and applicants.

üí¨ **Real-Time Chat System**

This app features a **floating real-time chat system** powered by **WebSockets (Socket.IO)**, allowing recruiters and job seekers to communicate instantly ‚Äî even across different sessions.

_‚ú® Key Features_

- Floating Chat Window: Opens as a modal for smooth access from anywhere in the app.

- Notification Badges: Displays the count of unread messages across chat rooms, even when the user is offline.

- Offline Message Sync: Messages sent while a user is logged out are tracked and displayed with a badge upon next login.

**üîé AI-Powered Job Matching Microservice**

This app includes a resume-to-job matching microservice using a Hugging Face-hosted LLM to find the most relevant job listings based on the content of your resume.

‚öôÔ∏è Backend reads resumes (from S3 in production or disk locally), extracts their text with pdf-parse, and calls the AI service.

ü§ñ Job descriptions are passed to a Hugging Face model for zero-shot classification. (previously we used facebook/bart-large-mnli but due to some model downtimes we now changed to MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli which is always hosted in huggingfaces)

üìä Results are scored and color-coded based on compatibility percentage.

‚öôÔ∏è **Admin Functionality**

- Full CRUD for users, companies, jobs, categories, statuses

- Filter and search functionality for easier record management

üåê **Multilingual Support**

Gigranger now supports a total of **10 languages** to offer a more inclusive and global user experience. The multilingual implementation was achieved using the [`i18next`](https://www.i18next.com/) internationalization library, integrated with `react-i18next` for seamless support across the React frontend.

### Supported Languages:

- **English** (default)
- **Espa√±ol** (Spanish)
- **Fran√ßais** (French)
- **Deutsch** (German)
- **Portugu√™s** (Portuguese)
- **‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä** (Hindi)
- **–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π** (Russian)
- **‰∏≠Êñá (ÁÆÄ‰Ωì)** (Chinese - Simplified)
- **Êó•Êú¨Ë™û** (Japanese)
- **ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©** (Arabic)

### Implementation Details:

- Language files are stored in `src/i18n/locales/{language}/translation.json`.
- Language switching is handled via a `<Select>` dropdown menu in the app header.
- Translations cover the whole UI elements as well as most of the errors received from the backend to be used for the snackbar component for user feedback operations.

  The translation system is fully scalable, allowing new languages to be added by simply extending the translation files and configuration.

## üìÑ Resume Upload Feature Details

As mentioned above, this project includes a file upload functionality for user resumes, which supports **both local storage (for development)** and **Amazon S3 storage (for production)**.

### üîÅ Automatic Storage Mode Detection

The app automatically switches between **local disk storage** and **S3 cloud storage** depending on the environment configuration:

| Environment | Storage Method | Trigger |

| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |

| Development | Local (project folder) | No `S3_BUCKET_NAME` defined in `.env` |

| Production | Amazon S3 | `S3_BUCKET_NAME` is defined in `.env` |

### üìÇ Local Storage (Development)

- Files are saved under:

`backend/uploads/resumes/`

- Ensure the following line is active in `app.js`:

```js
app.use(
  '/uploads/resumes',

  express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'uploads/resumes'))
);
```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Amazon S3 Storage (Production)

When the application is deployed in production and the environment is properly configured, resumes are uploaded to **Amazon S3** instead of being stored locally.

- Files are saved inside the `resumes/` folder within your S3 bucket.

- The uploaded file is publicly accessible using the returned S3 URL.

- Example of a stored file URL:

`https://gigranger.com/resumes/1745539929008-customerserviceresume.pdf`

To enable S3 uploads, ensure the following environment variables are defined in your `.env.production`:

| Variable | Description |

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |

| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Your AWS access key |

| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your AWS secret access key |

| `AWS_REGION` | AWS region (e.g., `us-east-2`) |

| `S3_BUCKET_NAME` | Your S3 bucket name |

If any of these are missing, the app will **automatically fallback to local storage**.

## üì¶ Frontend Architecture

The frontend follows a **Component-Driven Development (CDD)** approach, emphasizing separation of concerns:

- **Services** handle all API communication (e.g., `JobService`, `AuthService`).

- **Hooks** (e.g., `useJobCategories`, `useAuth`) encapsulate logic and data fetching.

- **Components** like tables, dialogs, and form inputs focus on UI rendering.

- **Pages** use these building blocks to compose full features.

This modular pattern improves reusability, testing, and clarity across the UI codebase.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Architecture

The backend is structured following Modular API Design principles using Express and Sequelize. This design allows for scalability, separation of concerns, and maintainability.

- **Controllers** handle business logic for each domain (e.g., `authController`, `jobController`, `chatController`).

- **Models** define Sequelize schemas and represent database tables (e.g., `User`, `Job`, `ChatMessage`).

- **Routes** map HTTP endpoints to controller methods (e.g., `jobRoute`, `authRoute`, `chatRoute`).

- **Middlewares** manage authentication, validation, error handling, and other reusable logic (e.g., `verifyToken`).

- **Sockets** enable real-time features like live chat using Socket.IO. Includes logic for joining rooms, broadcasting messages, and notifying users.

- **Utils and Services** provide shared utilities (e.g., file uploads with Multer, email publishing via RabbitMQ, and S3 integration).

- **Microservices**: The backend publishes events (e.g., email notifications) to RabbitMQ, which are consumed by the `gigranger-email-service` running on a separate EC2 instance. This decouples the main app from background job processing. - **Job Matching Microservice**: The backend integrates with a dedicated microservice to evaluate job-resume compatibility using an AI model from Hugging Face. This service runs independently on a Dockerized EC2 instance and is accessed securely via `mq.gigranger.com`. Resume files are parsed from either disk or S3 depending on the environment.

- **Test folder** contains backend unit/integration tests using Jest and Supertest.

This backend structure supports full API lifecycle management ‚Äî from secure user authentication to real-time communication ‚Äî and enables scalable feature development through modular services and message-driven architecture.

## üìå Disclaimer

This app began as a personal initiative to practice and explore full-stack development concepts using modern tools like React, Node.js, MySQL, and AWS. While it may not follow a single strict standard across all components ‚Äî for instance, some forms use Dialogs while others use Formik, and error handling varies between Axios responses and `console.error` ‚Äî this was intentional.

The goal has always been to build a progressively enhanced application while experimenting with different patterns, tools, and technologies. As it evolved, I incorporated more real-world features such as file uploads, email notifications, realtime chat, role-based access control, protected routes, and application history.

I plan to continue improving it with technologies like RabbitMQ, Docker Containerization, and more advanced patterns. This app is meant to be a learning-driven, functional foundation of a job portal, reflecting growth, curiosity, and hands-on problem solving.

So don‚Äôt judge it by perfection üòÑ
